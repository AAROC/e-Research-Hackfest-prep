# warmup problems

This should contain the typical frequently-encountered issues for various things. Try to list them according to the place where the _solution_ is made, not necessarily where the _problem_ is diagnosed.

## Network problems

  * ensure that the firewall can allow several connections

## Git problems

  * Installing Git Bash : there isn't a very clear process to install git bash


## SSH problems

  * Git bash ssh - git bash creates ssh keys with a file name `github_rsa` instead of `id_rsa`. This should be circumvented by copying the `github_rsa` files to `id_rsa`

## OAR problems

  * would be nice to have a json<->xml converter
